# examples
a repo to hold mis/little examples not worthy of their own repo.


`/null` is for examples used and maintained by the null channel for videos and demos given
`/community` is for people who want a place to put your examples and demos you would like to see others get to see! I will make sure to cover any new examples in my news section
